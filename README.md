# NBA Player Management App

Welcome to the NBA Player Management App repository! This project consists of a client-side web application built with React and Material-UI for managing NBA player data, as well as a server-side API built with NestJS for fetching player data from a third-party API.

## Project Overview

The NBA Player Management App is designed to provide users with a seamless experience for browsing and managing NBA player data. The client-side application offers features such as viewing player details, marking favorite players, searching for specific players, and more. On the server side, the API handles data fetching and processing to ensure that the client application receives accurate and up-to-date information.
